# ♟️ Ultimate Pro Chess Game - Java Edition

Welcome to **Ultimate Pro Chess Game**, a Java-based chess experience designed exclusively for the **chess pros** who already know the ropes (or at least think they do 😉). This game is for the brave ones who aren't afraid to challenge their friends on the same computer, with all the intense focus and trash-talking that local multiplayer brings!

Whether you're the next Magnus Carlsen or just someone who likes to move rooks and hope for the best, this is the chess game for you.

## Features

- 🎮 **Local Multiplayer**: Two players, one computer—prepare for mind games on and off the board.
- 💻 **Built in Java**: Relive the days of classic desktop gaming with a slick Java implementation.
- ♟️ **For Chess Pros**: No tutorials, no hints, no mercy. If you don't know how to move the pieces, this isn't the game for you.
- 🏰 **Fully Functional Piece Movement**: We’ve coded all your favorite pieces—pawns, knights, rooks, bishops, queens, and kings—to move just like they would in a real game. And yes, you can castle. Don't forget about en passant (because we did... just kidding).
- 🖼️ **Crisp, Clear Graphics**: The pieces actually look like chess pieces! Shoutout to `BufferedImage` for making that possible.
- 🐛 **Bug-Free* Gameplay**: (*This is a chess pun. Please ignore any actual bugs you find. We call them "features".)

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository (and bask in the glory of knowing you’re about to play chess like never before):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nirajgirii/chessGameJava.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE. (Come on, we know it’s IntelliJ or Eclipse. No judgment.)

3. Run the game, sit back, and challenge your opponent (who's conveniently sitting right next to you). No online multiplayer—this is old-school face-to-face battle.

4. Make your move by clicking and dragging the pieces across the board. Yes, they snap into place beautifully, as they should.

5. **Pro Tip**: Don’t lose your queen in the opening. We won’t stop you, but we will judge you.

## How to Win

- Checkmate the other player's king. Duh. You know how chess works, right?

- If you lose, claim your mouse was acting weird or the game is rigged. It’s tradition.

## Game Requirements

- **Java**: Make sure you have Java installed. Otherwise, how are you even playing this game?
- **A Friend**: This is a local multiplayer game, so you'll need someone to play with (or play against yourself—no judgment, we've all been there).

## Behind the Scenes (For the Nerds)

This game uses a solid `Piece` class to handle each chess piece’s behavior and movement. The logic is bulletproof (probably), and we’ve got special checks to prevent pieces from going where they shouldn’t. But hey, if you do manage to break it, let us know—it might even become a new feature!

## Known Features (A.K.A. Bugs We Know About)

- If you throw your computer in frustration after losing, the game may not run as smoothly after that.
- Pieces sometimes decide to vibe in places they shouldn’t be. We're working on teaching them some boundaries.
